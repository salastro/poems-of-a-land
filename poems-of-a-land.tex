    And died for the sake of the dead
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Did you think about his bet
    Did you believe the lies he said
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Did he do the right thing
    Did he hold the bright wing
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Will you do
    any better

    You will suffer with every sensation
    Yet won't get their only salutation
    While waiting for your expiration
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    You think for the unending duration
    About what to do for the approbation

\begin{verso}
    Could I do this
    Could I say that
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Can I be myself

\begin{verso}
    What a sleepless night
    Even the people sing without a bright
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    What a sleepless night
    Even the dead woke from the bed
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    And still, a sleepless night
    Did I tell you I saw the dead
    Did I tell you what I did
    Did I give you the shiny pet
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Yet still, a sleepless night
    Can you tell me where he hid
    Can you tell me what he did
    Can you tell me what's his bet
\end{verso}

\newpage

\begin{verso}
    And still, a sleepless night
    Can't we just get the list
    Can't we hope for the best
    Can't we die without the rest
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Yet still, a sleepless night
    Won't we die without a bye

    Just one more sleepless night
\end{verso}

\section{through live}

\begin{verso}
    \makebox[.6em][c]{\lettrine{F}{}}or what shall I live

    Can you believe the lost tall tree
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    But what will you do for the only living flee
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    For what shall I live
    For what shall I be
    Does it take you the same of me
    Does it make you the bumblebee
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    But what will you do for the great herd of lee
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    For what shall I live
    For what shall I be
    While being a worthless cup of tee
    While hating every single one of me
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    I shall not live
    I shall not be
\end{verso}

\section{as I do}

    \makebox[.6em][c]{\lettrine{D}{}}o you think I do
    What they told me to

\begin{verso}
    I am myself and not you
    I have my way to do what I do
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    The time of salves has passed away
    Yet you say I shouldn't take my way
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    The ones before you didn't choose the path for you
    Then why do you choose a path for other than you
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Didn't you set the path of yours
    Didn't they let you be your type of ores
\end{verso}

% \begin{verso}
%     Even the masters didn't force their slaves
%     Only the evil made them crave their own graves
% \end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    I am a master of my own
    Not the slave of your loan
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Then what will you do
    To force me to do
    What you believe to be true
    But in my eyes is only glue
    To what is always untrue
\end{verso}

\newpage

\begin{verso}
    Why so mad
    Of the standing fact
    That we both
    Aren't the same tooth
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Do what you do
    Until the death of our crew
    Be yourself
    And let no one decide your nerf
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Because at the end
    Isn't this like to attend
    The special life of your tend
\end{verso}

\section{at my death}

\begin{verso}
    I am dying alone
    I am suffering without a bone
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Like you told me long time ago
    No one will hold me when it's time to go
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    Am I sad
    For what I've done
    For what could've been
    Or for what the reality is
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    I don't know
    I've just said no
    To what I though is flaw
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    I just know
    I am sad
    Sadder than ever
\end{verso}

\begin{verso}
    So sad
    To even rhyme
    To talk about tonight
    To be alone without a light
\end{verso}

Because this is the end of my life
